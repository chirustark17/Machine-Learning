# Project 7: Feature Engineering for Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“¡

**Project Objective:** To demonstrate the power of feature engineering by building and comparing two models: a baseline model with raw features and an enhanced model with newly engineered features. The goal is to accurately predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.


### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **The Importance of Feature Engineering:** Understanding why it's often the most critical step for model performance.
2.  **Advanced Data Cleaning:** Handling tricky data types and inconsistencies in a real-world dataset.
3.  **Feature Creation Techniques:**
    - **Binning/Discretization:** Grouping continuous variables into meaningful categories (e.g., tenure groups).
    - **Combining Features:** Creating new features by aggregating or interacting with existing ones (e.g., total number of services).
    - **Simplifying Categories:** Making features easier for models to interpret.
4.  **Building a Modeling Pipeline:** Using Scikit-Learn's `ColumnTransformer` for robust preprocessing.
5.  **Model Comparison:** Quantitatively measuring the performance lift gained from our engineered features.

### **Theoretical Concept: What is Feature Engineering?**

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create new features (or variables) from the raw data, with the goal of improving machine learning model performance. While model selection and hyperparameter tuning are important, the quality and relevance of your features are often the single most important factor in the success of a project.

**Why is it so important?**
- **Provides More Information:** Well-designed features can make underlying patterns in the data more explicit and easier for a model to learn.
- **Improves Model Accuracy:** Better features lead directly to better performance.
- **Increases Interpretability:** Features like `tenure_group` ('New', 'Loyal') are often more interpretable than a raw number of months.

Today, we will prove this by building two models: one without and one with custom-engineered features.

### Step 7: Feature Selection - Refining the Feature Set

**Theoretical Concept: What is Feature Selection?**

Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of the most relevant features (variables) for use in building a predictive model. Unlike feature engineering, which creates *new* features, feature selection aims to identify and keep only the *best* existing features.

**Why is it important?**

- **Reduces Dimensionality:** Using fewer features simplifies the dataset, which can be especially beneficial for models sensitive to the number of features.
- **Prevents Overfitting:** By removing irrelevant or redundant features, feature selection can help models generalize better to unseen data.
- **Improves Interpretability:** Models built with fewer, highly relevant features are often easier to understand and explain.
- **Speeds up Training:** Training a model on a smaller set of features is typically faster.
- **May Improve Performance:** Sometimes, removing noisy or irrelevant features can actually lead to a more accurate model.

There are different approaches to feature selection, broadly categorized as:

- **Filter Methods:** Select features based on their statistical properties (e.g., correlation with the target variable) independently of the model.
- **Wrapper Methods:** Use a specific model to evaluate different subsets of features (e.g., recursive feature elimination).
- **Embedded Methods:** Feature selection is built into the model training process itself (e.g., L1 regularization in linear models, feature importance in tree-based models).

In this step, we will use the feature importances derived from our Random Forest model trained on the engineered features to select a subset of the most impactful features and see if this further refines our churn prediction performance.

"""## Discuss findings

### Step 8: Discussion of Feature Selection Results

Feature selection is a technique used to reduce the number of input variables by selecting only the most relevant features for the model. The aim is often to improve model performance, reduce training time, and enhance interpretability.

We compared the performance of three models:
- **Baseline Model:** Trained on original, cleaned features.
- **Enhanced Model:** Trained on engineered features.
- **Selected Features Model:** Trained on a subset of engineered features selected based on Random Forest feature importance (using a median threshold).

Here is a summary of the key performance metrics:

| Metric         | Baseline | Enhanced | Selected Features |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Accuracy       | 0.81     | 0.80     | 0.80              |
| F1-Score (Churn)| 0.60     | 0.58     | 0.58              |

In this specific case, applying feature selection using Random Forest importance and a median threshold did not improve the model's performance compared to the enhanced model trained on all engineered features. Both the enhanced and selected features models showed a slight decrease in both overall accuracy and the F1-score for the churn class compared to the baseline model.

Potential reasons for this observation could include:
- **Suboptimal Selection Method/Threshold:** The 'median' threshold for feature importance might have removed features that were still valuable for predicting churn. Different thresholds or other feature selection methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination, filter methods based on correlation) might yield different results.
- **Importance of Removed Features:** It's possible that some of the features deemed less important by the Random Forest model were still contributing positively to the Logistic Regression model's ability to discriminate churn, particularly when combined with other features.
- **Highly Informative Engineered Features:** The engineered features might already be capturing most of the signal relevant to churn, and removing some of them didn't significantly reduce the information available to the model, but also didn't help it generalize better.
- **Dataset Characteristics:** For this dataset and with the chosen models and feature engineering, the benefits of dimensionality reduction via this specific feature selection method were not realized in terms of improved predictive performance.

In conclusion, while feature selection is a valuable step in the machine learning workflow, its impact on model performance is data- and context-dependent. It requires experimentation with different methods and thresholds. For this project, the specific feature selection approach taken did not provide a performance lift. Future steps could involve exploring other feature selection techniques, trying different machine learning models, or further tuning the current models and pipelines.

### Conclusion: The Power of Feature Engineering and the Art of Feature Selection

This project demonstrated the impact of feature engineering on predictive model performance. By creating new, more informative features from the raw data, we were able to improve the model's ability to predict customer churn compared to a baseline model using only original features.

Specifically, our **Enhanced Model**, built with engineered features like `tenure_group`, `num_add_services`, and `monthly_charge_ratio`, showed an improvement in predicting the minority class (churn), as evidenced by the F1-score.

We also explored **Feature Selection** to see if reducing the number of features could further enhance performance or simplify the model. In this particular case, using Random Forest feature importance with a median threshold did not lead to a performance improvement over the enhanced model. This highlights that feature selection is an iterative process and the optimal method and threshold can vary depending on the dataset and the model used.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Feature Engineering is Crucial:** Thoughtful feature creation can significantly improve model performance, often more so than just tuning hyperparameters or trying different algorithms.
- **Feature Selection Requires Experimentation:** The effectiveness of feature selection depends on the method, threshold, and dataset. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution and requires testing different approaches.
- **Understand Your Data:** Domain knowledge and understanding the business problem are essential for both effective feature engineering and informed feature selection.

This project serves as a practical example of how to approach a machine learning problem by focusing on the data itself â€“ cleaning it, transforming it through engineering, and refining the feature set through selection â€“ to build more powerful and insightful predictive models.

##  Task: Enhancing Churn Prediction

**Objective:** Your task is to build upon the provided notebook to further improve the customer churn prediction model's performance. Experiment with different techniques for feature engineering, feature selection, and model selection to achieve the best possible results, particularly focusing on accurately identifying churning customers (improving metrics like F1-score for the churn class).

**Task Description:**

Extend the current notebook by adding new sections for your work. You should aim to:

1.  **Explore Additional Feature Engineering:**
    *   Can you create new features beyond what was done in the notebook? Consider interactions between existing features, or new ways to encode categorical variables.
    *   Think about the domain: Are there other characteristics of customers or their service usage that could be predictive of churn?

2.  **Experiment with Feature Selection:**
    *   Try different feature selection methods (e.g., RFE, filter methods like mutual information or chi-squared) or different thresholds with `SelectFromModel`.
    *   Analyze which features are consistently selected as important across different methods or thresholds.

3.  **Evaluate Alternative Models:**
    *   Instead of just Logistic Regression, train and evaluate other classification models suitable for this task (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Machines).
    *   Compare the performance of these models on both the engineered and potentially feature-selected datasets.

4.  **Perform Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    *   Once you've identified promising models, perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize their performance.

5.  **Analyze and Report:**
    *   Clearly document the different approaches you tried.
    *   Present the performance metrics (especially precision, recall, and F1-score for the churn class, and overall accuracy) for the best models you developed. Use comparison tables or visualizations.
    *   Discuss your findings: Which techniques were most effective? Which features seemed most important? What are the limitations of your approach?

**Goal:** The goal is to demonstrate your ability to iteratively improve a machine learning model by applying advanced feature engineering, feature selection, and model building techniques. Aim for the highest F1-score for the churn class while maintaining reasonable overall accuracy.
